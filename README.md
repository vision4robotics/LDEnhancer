# Light Distribution-Aware Enhancement for Low-Light UAV Tracking

Code and demo videos of LDEnhancer---a low-light enhancer towards facilitating UAV tracking at night with uneven light distribution.


# Abstract 
>Visual object tracking has boosted extensive intelligent applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) enhancer for nighttime UAV tracking always neglects the uneven light distribution in low-light images, inevitably leading to over-enhancement and saturation in bright regions. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., LDEnhancer, enhancing nighttime UAV tracking with light distribution suppression. Specifically, a novel light distribution suppression module is designed to capture light distribution, further estimating the suppression parameter map. Meanwhile, this work proposes a new image content enhancement module to estimate the enhancement parameter map. Finally, an innovative interweave iteration adjustment is proposed for the collaborative pixel-wise adjustment of low-light images, leveraging two parameter maps. Additionally, a challenging nighttime UAV tracking benchmark with uneven light distribution, namely NUTL40, is constructed to provide a comprehensive evaluation, which contains 40 challenging sequences with over 72K frames in total. Experimental results on the public authoritative UAV benchmarks and the proposed NUTL40 demonstrate that LDEnhancer outperforms other SOTA low-light enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking. Furthermore, real-world tests on a typical UAV platform with an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier confirm the practicality and efficiency of LDEnhancer. The code is available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/LDEnhancer.
